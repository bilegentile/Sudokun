# Sudokun
Sudokun is an app where you can play... sudokus!

Built in SwiftUI, this is a project that I used to learn more about Concurrency in Swift.

How? Sudokun makes API calls to Shadify, a serivce that provides a collection of puzzle games, like sudokus.
Also, I learned about Tasks in Swift trying to make everything work with the UI.

## Installation

You can try Sudokun for free on Testflight:
